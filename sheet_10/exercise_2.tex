\begin{recall}
  A map~$f \colon X \to Y$ between topological spaces~$X$ and~$Y$ is continuous if and only if
  \[
    f( \closure{A} )
    \subseteq
    \closure{f(A)}
  \]
  for every subset~$A \subseteq X$.
\end{recall}





\subsection{}

It holds that~$e \in U \subseteq \closure{U}$.
The inversion map~$i \colon G \to G$ is continuous and therefore satisfies
\[
  i(\closure{U})
  \subseteq
  \closure{ i(U) }
  =
  \closure{U} \,.
\]
This shows that~$\closure{U}^{-1} \subseteq \closure{U}$.
For every~$g \in U$ the left multiplication
\[
  \ell_g
  \colon
  G
  \to
  G \,,
  \quad
  h
  \mapsto
  gh
\]
is continuous and therefore satisfies
\[
  \ell_g( \closure{U} )
  \subseteq
  \closure{ \ell_g(U) }
  =
  \closure{U} \,.
\]
This shows that~$U \closure{U} \subseteq \closure{U}$.
We now use that for every~$h \in \closure{U}$ the right multiplication
\[
  r_h
  \colon
  G
  \to
  G \,,
  \quad
  g
  \mapsto
  gh
\]
is continuous and hence satisfies
\[
  r_h( \closure{U} )
  \subseteq
  \closure{ r_h(U) }
  \subseteq
  \closure{U} \,.
\]
This shows that~$\closure{U} \closure{U} \subseteq \closure{U}$.
We have altogether shown that~$\closure{U}$ is again a subgroup of~$G$.





\subsection{}

For every~$g \in U$ the commutator map
\[
  c_g
  \colon
  G
  \to
  G \,,
  \quad
  h
  \mapsto
  g h g^{-1} h
\]
in continous, and the singleton~$\{e\} \subseteq G$ is closed.
Hence
\[
  c_g(\closure{U})
  \subseteq
  \closure{ c_g(U) }
  =
  \closure{ \{e\} }
  =
  \{e\}
\]
because~$U$ is abelian.
This shows that every~$g \in U$ commutes with every~$h \in \closure{U}$.
By repeating this argument we find that every~$h \in \closure{U}$ commutes with every~$g \in \closure{U}$.
This shows that~$\closure{U}$ is abelian.
