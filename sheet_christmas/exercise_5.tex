\subsection{}

This given set is~$V(y^2 - x, z^3 - x)$ where~$k[\Aff^3] = k[x,y,z]$.





\subsection{}

Let~$k[\Aff^1] = k[t]$.

The set~$\Aff^1 = V(0)$ is closed.
For every~$x \in \Aff^1$ the singleton~$\{x_0\} = V(t - x)$ is closed.
Finite unions of closed subsets are again closed, therefore every finite subset is closed.

Let~$C \subseteq \Aff^1$ be any closed subset.
Then~$C = V(I)$ for some ideal~$I \subseteq k[t]$.
The algebra~$k[t]$ is a PID, therefore the ideal~$I$ is of the form~$I = (f)$ for some~$f \in k[t]$.
Then~$C = V(I) = V(f)$.
If~$f = 0$ then~$C = V(0) = \Aff^1$.
Otherwise the nonzero polynomial~$f$ has only finitey many roots, and then~$C = V(f)$ is finite.





\subsection{}

Suppose that the fields~$k$ is finite.
Let~$k[\Aff^n] = k[t_1, \dotsc, t_n]$.

For every point~$x = (x_1, \dotsc, x_n) \in \Aff^n$ the singleton
\[
  \{x\}
  =
  V(t_1 - x_1, \dotsc, t_n - x_n)
\]
is closed.
It follows that any subset~$C \subseteq \Aff^n$ is closed because it can be written as the finite union~$C = \bigcup_{x \in C} \{x\}$.
