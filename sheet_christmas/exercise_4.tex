\section{}

It follows from the Artin--Wedderburn theorem that
\[
  \Complex[G]
  \cong
  \mat{m_1}{\Complex}
  \times
  \dotsb
  \times
  \mat{m_r}{\Complex}
\]
where
\[
  n_i
  =
  \dim V_i
  =
  m_i \cdot \dim_\Complex \Complex
  =
  m_i \,.
\]
We therefore find that
\[
  \card{G}
  =
  \dim \Complex[G]
  =
  \sum_{i=1}^r m_i^2
  =
  \sum_{i=1}^r n_i^2  \,.
\]
