Let~$f \in \Jac(k[x])$, where~$\Jac(k[x])$ is the intersection of all maximal ideals of~$k[x]$.
The algebra~$k[x]$ contains infinitely many monic irreducible polynomials:
If~$p_1, \dotsc, p_n$ were all monic irreducible polynomials in~$k[x]$ then the polynomial~$\prod_{i=1}^n p_i + 1$ is not divisible by any~$p_i$, which contradicts~$k[x]$ being a UFD.%
\footnote{This is a classical proof technique due to Euclid.}

It follows for every such monic irreducible polynomial~$p$ that~$p \divides f$ because~$f \in (p)$ (where we use that~$k[x]$ is a PID and~$(p)$ therefore already maximal).
This means that~$f = 0$ because~$k[x]$ is a UFD.
