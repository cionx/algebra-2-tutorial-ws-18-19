We instead show the following more general \lcnamecref{bourbaki}, from which we then deduce the equivalence from the exercise:

\begin{lemma}
  \label{bourbaki}
  Let~$A = \bigoplus_{d \geq 0} A_d$ be a graded, commutative~{\kalg}.
  Then for a family~$(x_i)_{i \in I}$ of homogenenous elements~$x_i$ of degree~$\deg(x_i) \geq 1$ the following conditions are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \label{ideal}
      The elements~$(x_i)_{i \in I}$ generate the ideal~$A^+ \defined \bigoplus_{d \geq 1} A_d$ of~$A$.
    \item
      \label{algebra}
      The elements~$(x_i)_{i \in I}$ generate~$A$ as an~\dash{$A_0$}{algebra}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that the ideal~$A^+$ is generated by~$(x_i)_{i \in I}$ and let~$A' \defined A_0[x_i \suchthat i \in I]$ be the~\dash{$A_0$}{subalgebra} of~$A$ generated by~$(x_i)_{i \in I}$.
  We show that~$A_d \subseteq A'$ for all~$d \geq 0$ by induction.
  
  For~$d = 0$ we have~$A_0 \subseteq A'$ by definition of~$A'$.
  Suppose that~$d \geq 1$ and that~$A_0, \dotsc, A_{d-1} \subseteq A'$.
  It then holds that~$A_d \subseteq A^+$ and hence for~$x \in A_d$ that~$x \in A^+$.
  We may therefore write
  \[
      x
    = \sum_{i \in I} a_i x_i
  \]
  for some coefficients~$a_i \in A$ (where~$a_i = 0$ for all but finitely many~$i$).
  We can then decompose every coefficient~$a_i$ as~$a_i = \sum_{d' \geq 0} a'_{i,d'}$ with~$a'_{i,d'}$ homogeneous of degree~$d'$.
  We get that
  \[
      x
    = \sum_{i \in I} a_i x_i
    = \sum_{d' \geq 0} \sum_{i \in I} a'_{i,d'} x_i \,.
  \]
  The element~$x$ on the left-hand side is homogeneous of degree~$d$, and the summand~$a_{i,d'} x_i$ on the right-hand side is homogeneous of degree~$d' + \deg(x_i)$.
  We therefore find by comparing homogeneous components that
  \[
      x
    = \sum_{i \in I} a'_{i, d-\deg(x_i)} x_i
  \]
  where we set~$a'_{i,d'} = 0$ for~$d' < 0$.
  Hence we may assume that the coefficients~$a_i$ are homogeneous of degree~$d - \deg(x_i) < d - 1$.
  It then follows by induction hypothesis that the coefficients~$a_i$ are contained in~$A'$.
  Hence
  \[
              x
    =         \sum_{i \in I} a_i x_i
    \in       \sum_{i \in I} A' x_i
    \subseteq \sum_{i \in I} A'
    =         A' \,.
  \]
  This shows that also~$A_d \subseteq A'$.
  
  Suppose on the other hand that~$A_0$ is generated by~$(x_i)_{i \in I}$ as an~\dash{$A_0$}{algebra}.
  Then the monomials~$x_{i_1} \dotsm x_{i_r}$ with~$i_1, \dotsc, i_r \in I$ generate~$A$ as an~{\module{$A_0$}}.
  These generators are homogeneous, and hence the \dash{$A_0$}{submodule}~$A^+$ is generated by those monomials of degree~$\geq 1$, which are those monomials with~$r \geq 1$.
  We have for these monomials that
  \[
        x_{i_1} \dotsm x_{i_r}
    =   x_{i_1} \dotsm x_{i_{r-1}} x_{i_r}
    \in A x_{i_r} \,.
  \]
  This shows that~$A^+$ is generated by~$(x_i)_{i \in I}$ as an ideal.
\end{proof}

We now show how the exercise follows from the above \lcnamecref{bourbaki}:

If~$A^+$ is generated by finitely many elements~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$, then we may replace each generator~$x_i$ by all of its homogeneous components to assume that~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ are homogeneous;
these generators are necessarily of homogeneous degree~$\deg(x_i) \geq 1$ because~$x_i \in A^+$.
It then follows from the above \lcnamecref{bourbaki} that~$A$ is generated by~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ as an~\dash{$A_0$}{algebra}.

Suppose on the other hand~$A$ is generated by finitely many elements~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ as an~\dash{$A_0$}{algebra}
We may replace each generator~$x_i$ by all of its homogeneous components to assume that~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ are homogeneous.
We may then also remove the generators of degree~$0$, as they are not needed.
It then follows from the above \lcnamecref{bourbaki} that~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ generate~$A^+$ as an ideal.

\begin{remark}
  If it not needed that~$A_0$ is noetherian.
  But if~$A_0$ is notherian, then one can given a shorter proof of one of the impliciation:
  
  If~$A_0$ is noetherian and~$A$ is finitely generated as an~\dash{$A_0$}{algebra} then~$A$ is also noetherian by Hilbertâ€™s~basis~theorem.
  It then follows that the ideal~$A^+$ of~$A$ is finitely generated.
\end{remark}
